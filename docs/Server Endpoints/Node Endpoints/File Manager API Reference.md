## About the File Manager API Endpoint

The fileManager.ts file defines an Express app.post() route handler for the `/app/syncFile` endpoint. This endpoint is used to synchronize files in Jan.

## Why use the syncFile endpoint

The syncFile endpoint allows synchronizing files between the Jan server and clients. For example, it could be used to upload a file from a client to the Jan server.

## Request body parameters

The request body does not appear to be used in the provided route handler, so there are likely no required parameters. The route handler may access the request object for things like headers or url parameters.

## Prerequisites

- The Jan server must be running to handle requests
- Clients need authorization to access the endpoint

## Example request

Here is an example curl request to the syncFile endpoint:

```
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:1337/app/syncFile \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```

This posts to the syncFile endpoint to synchronize a file. The authorization header would contain an access token to authorize the request.
