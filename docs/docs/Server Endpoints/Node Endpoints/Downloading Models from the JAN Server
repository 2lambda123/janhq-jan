## About the JAN Server and API Endpoints

Jan endpoints are endpoints from the JAN node js libary that run on port 1337.

## Why should I use this API Endpoint
The `/models/download/:modelId` endpoint is used to download a model from the JAN server. This can be useful for getting a model that you have trained or for sharing models with others.

## What is the query or body params required?

The following query parameters are required:

* `modelId`: The ID of the model to download.

## Prequsites

* You must have a JAN server running on port 1337.
* You must have a model trained and saved on the JAN server.

## What is an example Curl to this endpoint.

The following curl command will download the model with the ID `my-model` from the JAN server:

```
curl -X GET "http://localhost:1337/models/download/my-model" -o my-model.zip
```

## Why and How
The `downloadModel` endpoint is a simple GET endpoint that returns a zip file containing the model files. The model files are stored in a subdirectory of the zip file named after the model ID.

The following is an example of the contents of a model zip file:

```
my-model.zip
├── my-model
│   ├── model.json
│   └── model.bin
└── metadata.json
```

The `model.json` file contains the model metadata, such as the model name, version, and training parameters. The `model.bin` file contains the model weights. The `metadata.json` file contains information about the model, such as the author, license, and description.

## Conclusion
The `downloadModel` endpoint is a useful tool for getting models from the JAN server. This can be useful for getting a model that you have trained or for sharing models with others.
