## About the JAN Server and API Endpoints

Jan endpoints are endpoints from the JAN node js libary that run on port 1337.
  
## Why should I use this API Endpoint
This endpoint is used to join two or more arrays together.

## What is the query or body params required?
The body of the request should be an array of arrays.

## Prequsites
None

## What is an example Curl to this endpoint.
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:1337/app/joinPath -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]'
```

## Explanation
The above curl command will send a POST request to the `/app/joinPath` endpoint with the following body:

```
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
```

The endpoint will then join the two arrays together and return the result as a JSON string.

In this example, the result will be:

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
