## About the JAN Server and API Endpoints

Jan endpoints are endpoints from the JAN node js libary that run on port 1337.
  
## Why should I use this API Endpoint
The `downloadFile` endpoint allows you to download a file from a specified URL and save it to a specified location on your computer. This can be useful for downloading files that are not available for direct download, or for downloading files that you want to keep a local copy of.

## What is the query or body params required?

The `downloadFile` endpoint requires the following query parameters:

* `url`: The URL of the file that you want to download.
* `path`: The path to the location on your computer where you want to save the file.

## What is an example Curl to this endpoint.

The following curl command will download the file `https://example.com/file.zip` and save it to the file `~/Downloads/file.zip` on your computer:

```
curl -L -o ~/Downloads/file.zip https://example.com/file.zip
```

## Make sure explain the why and how in the documentation.

The `-L` option tells curl to follow redirects, and the `-o` option tells curl to save the output to the specified file.

## If you see anything inside of a **{{}}**, it is a placeholder, please replace accordingly with the right content properly

## Most importantly do not generate any information that does not reflect the current code and CONTEXT provided above, this is the most important rule

The code you provided is a Node.js script that uses the `request` and `progress` modules to download a file from a specified URL and save it to a specified location on the computer. The script also uses the `createWriteStream` function to create a writable stream to the specified file, and the `on` method to listen for events on the stream.

The `progress` module is used to track the progress of the download, and the `onProgress` function is used to display the progress in the console. The `onError` function is used to handle any errors that occur during the download, and the `onEnd` function is used to perform any necessary cleanup after the download is complete.
