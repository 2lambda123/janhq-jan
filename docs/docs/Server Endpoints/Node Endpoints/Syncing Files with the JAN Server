## About the JAN Server and API Endpoints

Jan endpoints are endpoints from the JAN node js libary that run on port 1337.
  
## Why should I use this API Endpoint
This endpoint is used to sync a file from the local file system to the Jan server. This can be useful for keeping files up-to-date between multiple devices or for backing up files to the cloud.

## What is the query or body params required?
The following query or body params are required:

* `file`: The path to the file that you want to sync.
* `name`: The name of the file that you want to sync to.

## Prequsites
Before you can use this API endpoint, you must have the following:

* A Jan server running on port 1337.
* A file that you want to sync.

## What is an example Curl to this endpoint.
The following is an example curl command that you can use to sync a file from the local file system to the Jan server:

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:1337/app/syncFile -F file=@/path/to/file -F name=file.txt
```

## Explanation
The above curl command will send a POST request to the `/app/syncFile` endpoint on the Jan server. The `-F file=@/path/to/file` option specifies the path to the file that you want to sync. The `-F name=file.txt` option specifies the name of the file that you want to sync to.

The Jan server will then sync the file from the local file system to the server. The file will be stored in the `files` directory on the server.

## Conclusion
The `/app/syncFile` endpoint is a useful tool for keeping files up-to-date between multiple devices or for backing up files to the cloud.
