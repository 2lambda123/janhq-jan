This page explains all the architecture of [Jan](https://Jan/).

## Jan Platform

![Platform](../img/arch-connection.drawio.png)

### Overview

The architecture of Jan can be thought of as a layered system, comprising of the FrontEnd, Middleware, and BackEnd. Each layer has distinct components and responsibilities, ensuring a modular and scalable approach.

### FrontEnd
The **FrontEnd** is the visible part of Jan that interacts directly with the user.

- **Controller:** This is the main control unit of the FrontEnd. It processes the user's inputs, handles UI events, and communicates with other layers to fetch or send data.

- **Apps:** This represents applications or extensions that can be integrated with Jan.

- **Execute Request** act as the initial triggers to initiate processes within the application.

### Middleware

It's a bridge between the FrontEnd and BackEnd. It's responsible for translating requests and ensuring smooth data flow.

- **SDK:** Stands for Software Development Kit. It provides a set of tools, libraries, and guidelines for developers to build and integrate custom applications or features with Jan.

- **Core:** It's tasked with managing the connections between the FrontEnd and BackEnd. It ensures data is routed correctly and efficiently between the two.

- **Local Native:** Refers to the connectors that enable communication with local services or applications. This will use your own hardware to ddeploy models.

- **Cloud Native:** As the name suggests, these connectors are tailored for cloud-based interactions, allowing Jan to leverage cloud services or interact with other cloud-based applications.

The Middleware communicates with the BackEnd primarily through **IPC** for Local and **Http** for Cloud.

### BackEnd

It is responsible for data processing, storage, and other core functionalities.

- **Plugins:** Extendable modules that can be added to the Jan system to provide additional functionalities or integrations with third-party applications.

- **Nitro:** This is a high-performance engine or a set of services that power specific functionalities within Jan. Given its placement in the architecture, it's reasonable to assume that Nitro provides acceleration or optimization capabilities for tasks.

## Jan workflow

![Workflow](../img/arch-flow.drawio.png)

### Overview

The architecture of the Jan desktop application is structured into four primary modules: "Prompt Template," "Language Model," "Output Parser," and "Apps." Let's break down each module and understand its components.

### Prompt Template

This is where predefined templates are stored. It sets the format and structure for user interactions. It contains:

- **Character's definition:**

Definitions of various characters or entities that may be interacted with or invoked during user requests (e.g., name, personality, and communication style).

- **Model's definition:**

Definitions related to the different language models (e.g., objectives, capabilities, and constraints)

- **Examples:**

Sample inputs and outputs for guidance. If given good examples, LLM could enable basic reasoning or planning skills.

- **Input:**

The actual user query or request that is being processed.

### Large Language Model

This processes the input provided.

- **Local models:**

These are the downloaded models that reside within the system. They can process requests without the need to connect to external resources.

- **OpenAI:**

This will connect you with OpenAI API, allowing the application to utilize powerful models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.

:::info
To use OpenAI models, you must have an OpenAI account and secret key. You can get your [OpenAI key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) here.
:::

- **Custom Agents:**

These are user-defined or third-party models that can be integrated into the Jan system for specific tasks.

### Output Parser

Language models produce textual content. However, often, there's a need for more organized data instead of plain text. This is achieved using output parsers.

- **Parser:**

This component ensures that the output conforms to the desired structure and format, removing unwanted information or errors.

### Apps

This represents applications or extensions that can be integrated with Jan.

- **Characters:** Characters or entities that can be utilized within the applications.

- **Models:** Different Large Language Models, Large Multimodal Models, and Stable Diffusion models that the apps might use.

- **RAG:** Represents a "Retrieval Augmented Generation" functionality, which helps in fetching relevant data and generating responses based on it.

## Synchronous architecture

### Overview

The architecture of the Jan application is designed to provide a seamless experience for the users while also being modular and extensible.

### BackEnd and FrontEnd

**BackEnd:**

- The BackEnd serves as the brain of the application. It processes the information, performs computations, and manages the main logic of the system.

:::info
This is like an [OS (Operating System)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) in the computer.
:::

**FrontEnd:**

- The FrontEnd is the interface that users interact with. It takes user inputs, displays results, and communicates with the BackEnd through Inter-process communication bi-directionally.

:::info
This is like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) application
:::
    
**Inter-process communication:**

- A mechanism that allows the BackEnd and FrontEnd to communicate in real time. It ensures that data flows smoothly between the two, facilitating rapid response and dynamic updates.

### Plugins and Apps
**Plugins:**

In Jan, Plugins contains all the core features. They could be Core Plugins or [Nitro](https://github.com/janhq/nitro)

- **Load:** This denotes the initialization and activation of a plugin when the application starts or when a user activates it.

- **Implement:** This is where the main functionality of the plugin resides. Developers code the desired features and functionalities here. This is a "call to action" feature.

- **Dispose:** After the plugin's task is completed or deactivated, this function ensures that it releases any resources it uses, providing optimal performance and preventing memory leaks.

:::info
This is like [Extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode) in VSCode.
:::

**Apps:**
 
Apps are basically Plugin-like. However, Apps can be built by users for their own purposes.

> For example, users can build a `Personal Document RAG App` to chat with specific documents or articles.

With **Plugins and Apps**, users can build a broader ecosystem surrounding Jan.

## Asynchronous architecture

![Asynchronous architecture](../img/arch-async.drawio.png)

### Overview

The asynchronous architecture allows Jan to handle multiple operations simultaneously without waiting for one to complete before starting another. This results in a more efficient and responsive user experience. The provided diagram breaks down the primary components and their interactions.

### Components

#### Results

After processing certain tasks or upon specific triggers, the backend can broadcast the results. This could be a processed data set, a calculated result, or any other output that needs to be shared.

#### Events

Similar to broadcasting results but oriented explicitly towards events. This could include user actions, system events, or notifications that other components should be aware of.

- **Notify:**

Upon the conclusion of specific tasks or when particular triggers are activated, the system uses the Notify action to send out notifications from the **Results**. The Notify action is the conduit through which results are broadcasted asynchronously, whether they concern task completions, errors, updates, or any processed data set.

- **Listen:**

Here, the BackEnd actively waits for incoming data or events. It is geared towards capturing inputs from users or updates from plugins.

#### Plugins

These are modular components or extensions designed to enhance the application's functionalities. Each plugin possesses a "Listen" action, enabling it to stand by for requests emanating from user inputs.

### Flow

1. Input is provided by the user or an external source.
2. This input is broadcasted as an event into the **Broadcast event**.
3. The **BackEnd** processes the event. Depending on the event, it might interact with one or several Plugins.
4. Once processed, **Broadcast result** can be sent out asynchronously through multiple notifications via Notify action.
