Jan SDK is an **extensible framework** that lets you build and run AI applications everywhere, with an emphasis on local first.

It is available across Mac, Windows, Linux Desktops. It is also available as a headless server that can be deployed into any on-prem or cloud environments.

This framework is packaged and regularly published as an SDK through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/org/janhq) and [pip](https://pypi.org/).

The SDK provides built-in support for the following:

- Native OS integrations with Electron and Chromium
- Native server integrations with Nodejs
- Native mobile integrations with Capacitor (coming soon)

:::tip
The [Jan Desktop client](https://github.com/janhq/jan/releases) is built with Jan SDK. This means you can customize any part of the application from the branding to the features, and truly make it your own.
