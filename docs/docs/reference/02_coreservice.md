`CoreService` provides an interface for implementing custom methods in Jan.
It lets you define shared behavior across your custom application, like how your app handles state, models, or inferencing behavior.

## Usage

```js
import { CoreService, ... } from "@janhq/core";
```

- `StoreService`
- `DataService`

- `StopModel`: Stops a running inference model.

## ModelManagementService

The `ModelManagementService` enum provides methods for managing models:

- `GetDownloadedModels`: Gets a list of downloaded models.
- `GetAvailableModels`: Gets a list of available models from data store.
- `DeleteModel`: Deletes a downloaded model.
- `DownloadModel`: Downloads a model from the server.
- `SearchModels`: Searches for models on the server.
- `GetConfiguredModels`: Gets configured models from the data store.
- `StoreModel`: Stores a model in the data store.
- `UpdateFinishedDownloadAt`: Updates the finished download time for a model in the data store.
- `GetUnfinishedDownloadModels`: Gets a list of unfinished download models from the data store.
- `GetFinishedDownloadModels`: Gets a list of finished download models from the data store.
- `DeleteDownloadModel`: Deletes a downloaded model from the data store.
- `GetModelById`: Gets a model by its ID from the data store.

## PreferenceService

The `PreferenceService` enum provides methods for managing plugin preferences:

- `ExperimentComponent`: Represents the UI experiment component for a testing function.

## SystemMonitoringService
