title: About Jan
---

Jan believes in the need for an open source AI ecosystem, and are building the infra and tooling to allow open source AIs to compete on a level playing field with proprietary ones.

Jan's long-term vision is to build a cognitive framework for future robots, who are practical, useful assistants for humans and businesses in everyday life. 

## Why does Jan Exist?

### Mission

Our mission is to allow humans and businesses to own their AI, with the right to tinker, repair and innovate. 

### Ideal Customer

Our ideal customer is an AI enthusiast or business who has experienced some limitations with OpenAI, and is keen to find open source alternatives. 

### Problems

Our ideal customer would use Jan to solve one of these problems. 

*Control*
- Control (e.g. preventing vendor lock-in)
- Stability (e.g. runs predictably every time)
- Local-use (e.g. for speed, or for airgapped environments)
 
*Privacy*
- Data protection (e.g. personal data or company data)
- Privacy (e.g. nsfw) 

*Customizability*

### Solution

Jan is a seamless user experience that runs on your personal computer, that glues the different pieces of the open source AI ecosystem to provide an alternative to OpenAI's closed platform. 

- We build a comprehensive, seamless platform that takes care of the technical chores across the stack required to run open source AI
- We run on top of a local folder of non-proprietary files, that anyone can tinker with (yes, even other apps!) 
- We provide open formats for packaging and distributing AI to run reproducibly across devices
