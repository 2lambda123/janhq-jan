You may receive a "Error Occured: Failed to Fetch" response when you first start chatting with a selected model.

This may occur due to several reasons. Please follow these steps to resolve it:

1. Ensure you are on the latest version of Mac, Windows or Ubuntu OS version

   - Upgrading to the latest version has resolved this issue for most people

2. Select a model that is smaller than 80% of your hardware V/RAM.

   - For example, if you have a 8GB machine, you should select models smaller than 6GB.

3. Install the latest [Nightly release](https://jan.ai/install/nightly/)

   - If you are re-installing Jan, it can help to [clear the application cache](https://jan.ai/troubleshooting/stuck-on-broken-build/)

4. Ensure your V/RAM is accessible by the application (some people have virtual RAM)

5. If you are on Nvidia GPUs, please download [Cuda](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
