  See the [Build from Source](/install/from-source) guide.

### Working with Models

Jan provides a list of recommended models to get you started.
You can find them in the in-app Hub.

1. `cmd + k` and type "hub" to open the Hub.
2. Download your preferred models.
3. `cmd + k` and type "chat" to open the conversation UI and start chatting.
4. Your model may take a few seconds to start up.
5. You can customize the model settings, at each conversation thread level, on the right panel.
6. To change model defaults globally, edit the `model.json` file. See the [Models](/guides/models) guide.

### Importing Models

Jan is compatible with all GGUF models.

For more information on how to import custom models, not found in the Hub, see the [Models](/guides/models) guide.

## Working with the Local Server

> This feature is currently under development. So expect bugs!

Jan runs a local server on port `1337` by default.

The endpoints are OpenAI compatible.

See the [API server guide](/guides/server) for more information.
