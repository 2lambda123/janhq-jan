## About the JAN Server and API Endpoints

Jan endpoints are endpoints from the JAN node js libary that run on port 1337.
  
## Why should I use this API Endpoint
This endpoint is used to synchronize a file with the server. This can be useful for keeping track of changes to a file, or for sharing a file with other users.

## Prequsites
Before you can use this endpoint, you must have a JAN server running on port 1337. You can start a JAN server by running the following command:

```
npm start
```

## What is an example Curl to this endpoint
The following curl command will synchronize a file named `myfile.txt` with the JAN server:

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:1337/app/syncFile -F file=@myfile.txt
```

The response from the server will be a JSON object containing the following information:

* `success`: A boolean value indicating whether the file was successfully synchronized.
* `message`: A message describing the status of the synchronization.
* `data`: An object containing the synchronized file data.

## How does this endpoint work?
This endpoint works by first checking if the file already exists on the server. If the file does not exist, it is created. If the file already exists, it is overwritten with the new data.

The endpoint then sends a response to the client containing the status of the synchronization.

## Why is this endpoint useful?
This endpoint is useful for keeping track of changes to a file, or for sharing a file with other users. For example, you could use this endpoint to synchronize a file with a cloud storage service, or to share a file with your team members.
