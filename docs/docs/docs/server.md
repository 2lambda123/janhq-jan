Jan ships with a built-in API server, that can be used as a drop-in replacement for OpenAI's API. 

Jan runs on port `1337` by default, but this can be changed in Settings. 

Check out the [API Reference](/api-reference) for more information on the API endpoints.

```
curl https://localhost:1337/v1/chat/completions

```
