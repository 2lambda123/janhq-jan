## Uninstallation

As Jan is development mode, you might get stuck on a broken build.

To reset your installation:

1. Delete Jan from your `/Applications` folder

2. Delete Application data:
   ```sh
   # Newer versions
   rm -rf /Users/$(whoami)/Library/Application\ Support/jan

   # Versions 0.2.0 and older
   rm -rf /Users/$(whoami)/Library/Application\ Support/jan-electron
   ```
   
3. Clear Application cache:
   ```sh
   rm -rf /Users/$(whoami)/Library/Caches/jan*
   ```

4. Use the following commands to remove any dangling backend processes:

    ```sh
    ps aux | grep nitro
    ```

    Look for processes like "nitro" and "nitro_arm_64," and kill them one by one with:

    ```sh
    kill -9 <PID>
    ```
